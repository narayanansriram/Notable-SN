# Notable-SN

By Sriram Narayanan

This app was written for a node JS server deployment. Frameworks used were expressJS and mysql for node. All dependencies are included in the package.json file. Once in the node JS command prompt, just enter "npm install" which will install all required packages (if prompted also enter "npm audit fix")

<u>SQL connection:</u>
In the server.js file, input appropriate credentials to the mysql.createPool entry on line 10.

<u>Running the app</u>
Now, it is time to run the app. Navigate to the folder in the node JS app and then type in
 :> node server.js
The app is now ready for use!
